		use https://github.com/TheBodger/MMM-FeedUtilities to setup the MMM-Feed... dependencies and  install all modules.

## Installation
To install the module, use your terminal to:
1. Navigate to your MagicMirror's modules folder. If you are using the default installation directory, use the command:<br />`cd ~/MagicMirror/modules`
2. Clone the module:<br />`git clone https://github.com/TheBodger/MMM-ModulePosition`

## Using the module

### MagicMirror² Configuration

To use this module, add the following minimum configuration block to the END of the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
		{
			module: "MMM-ModulePosition",
			position: "fullscreen_below",
		},
```
This module uses the names allocated by the MM process, which will change depending on their absolute order within the config files. MAke sure that this module is the last in the configuration file to ensure all modules have the correct name when the new layout is saved.

If the module is added to the config, it will use the previous layout saved if still available.

Once the layout is saved, using the SAVE button, then apply them as follows so that they are used by the MM and you can remove this module from the configuration file.
